<!-- Hi Professor Levi, I completed the homework for today; you can see the results at: https://andrewthomasw.github.io/ 
It took me about 4 hours.

I had some challenges with : splitting the strings in order to display them in one line in the ascii animation assignment. i also had some challenges getting started with mocha especially testing functions with array object out comes.
i managed to fix all this and  the assignment is complete now. -->
